# CHALLENGE CODE REFACTOR

## Description

*Challenge Code Refactor* is an on-the-job ticket request from a marketing agency called Horiseon. They provided starter code and requested that I help them follow accessibility standards so that their website is optimized for search engines.

Horiseon provided a list of acceptance criteria. It goes as follows:

- ~~GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards~~

- ~~WHEN I view the source code~~
- ~~THEN I find semantic HTML elements~~

- ~~WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements~~
- ~~THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning~~

- ~~WHEN I view the image elements~~
- ~~THEN I find accessible alt attributes~~

- ~~WHEN I view the heading attributes~~
- ~~THEN they fall in sequential order~~

- ~~WHEN I view the title element~~
- ~~THEN I find a concise, descriptive title~~


Furthermore,

Technical
- ~~Application links all function correctly~~
- ~~Application CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure~~
- ~~Application's CSS file is properly commented~~

Deployment
- ~~Application deployed at live URL~~
- ~~Application loads with no errors~~
- ~~Application GitHub URL submitted~~

Application Quality
- ~~Application resembles at least 90% of the original screenshots~~

Repository Quality

- ~~Repository has a unique name~~
- ~~Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions~~
- ~~Repository follows best practices for class / id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.~~
- ~~Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages~~
- ~~Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshots, and link to deployed application~~
